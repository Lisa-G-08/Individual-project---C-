The above file gives a valid path from departure point to destination point obtained from input file(data_input.txt) and writes output in output file(data_output.txt).

Please note that the main.cpp file imports the GetPath.cpp file while GetPath.cpp file imports the Airlines.cpp, Routes.cpp and Airports.cpp.

Therefore all files must be stored in the same project file

Additionally all code is run in the main.cpp file
